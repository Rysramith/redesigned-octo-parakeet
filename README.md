S16's Extension janky-ass CE Patch (sorta?). I suck at coding this shit, but my willpower and refusal to play without CE has pushed me to make this crap. Download the zip, place it in the 'patches' folder in your CE mod directory after unzipping it, and the flogger (and only the flogger since you can't make the whip and shit) should work and do the sex moment crap. (You gotta do this because I have no clue how to make a file that auto patches it, so suck it up lol)
